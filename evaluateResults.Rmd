```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Get the model function, and also load the real life data.

```{r}
source("modelCode_rewiring.R")
load("data/southernEdges2021.Rda")
```

Make 5-day graphs from the real data:

```{r}
realGraphs <- vultureUtils::makeGraphs(edges = southernEdges2021, interval = "5 days", 
                       dateTimeStart = "2021-01-01 00:00:00",
                       dateTimeEnd = "2021-12-31 11:59:00",
                       weighted = FALSE, allVertices = TRUE)$graphs
```


Run the model with 82 individuals:

```{r} 
modelGraphs <- runModel(N = 82, burn.in = 50, burn.out = 50) %>%
  lapply(., function(x){
    igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(x, mode = "undirected")
  })
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Load packages
```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(tidygraph)
```

### Set some initial parameter values
```{r}
n <- 30 # number of individuals
density <- 0.15 # initial density of the network (proportion of edges, out of all possible edges)
seed <- 3 # for reproducible results
remove <- 0.1 # probability of removing an edge, given that it exists
create <- 0.05 # probability of creating an edge, given that it doesn't exist
days <- 10 # how many days to run the simulation for.
```

### Create an initial adjacency matrix
```{r}
# Initialize
set.seed(seed)
initialConnections <- sample(0:1, size = n*n, replace = T, prob = c(1-density, density))
# Create the initial adjacency matrix
am_init <- matrix(data = initialConnections, nrow = n, ncol = n)
# Make the AM into a graph so we can operate on it
init_graph <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(am_init, weighted = NULL, mode = "undirected", diag = FALSE)
# Name nodes
V(init_graph)$name <- paste0("n", 1:n)
```
